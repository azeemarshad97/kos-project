Knowledge-based Access to Historical Texts
### Goal: create a topic-based reading interface for historical texts. Produce virtual documents by
assembling related text fragments
- create a knowledge graph for semantically indexing the texts
  - create an ontology (people, places, events, activities, objects, …)
- develop a "query" system to navigate the knowledge graph, access the texts, and generate/assemble virtual documents

### Sources
